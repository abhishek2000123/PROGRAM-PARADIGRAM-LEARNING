  <h1 class="text-warning">PROGRAMMING PARADIGRAMS</h1>
  <p class="text-danger">Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task. Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. Apart from varieties of programming language there are lots of paradigms to fulfil each and every demand.</p>

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>IMPERATIVE PARADIGRAM</h2></div>


  <p>Imperative programming is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer. Unlike declarative programming, which describes "what" a program should accomplish, imperative programming explicitly tells the computer "how" to accomplish it. Programs written this way often compile to binary executables that run more efficiently since all CPU instructions are themselves imperative statement</p>



  <p>Advantage:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Very simple to implement</li>
    <li>It contains loops, variables etc</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Disadvantage:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Complex problem cannot be solved</li>
    <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
    <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
  </ol>

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>PROGEDURAL PARADIGRAM</h2></div>


  <p>This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of under lying machine model. There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach. It has the ability to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of its reusability.</p>



  <p>Languages that use Procedurel</p>

    <li>C : developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson</li>
    <li>C++ : developed by Bjarne Stroustrup</li>

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>OBJECT ORIENTED PARADIGRAM</h2></div>


  <p>The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication. The smallest and basic entity is object and all kind of computation is performed on the objects only. More emphasis is on data rather procedure. It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario.</p>


  <p>Advantages of object oriented</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Data security</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Code reusability</li>

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</h2></div>


  <p>Declarative programming is a programming paradigm in which the programmer defines what needs to be accomplished by the program without defining how it needs to be implemented. In other words, the approach focuses on what needs to be achieved instead of instructing how to achieve it. It is different from an imperative program which has the command set to resolve a certain set of problems by describing the steps required to find the solution. Declarative programming describes a particular class of problems with language implementation taking care of finding the solution. The declarative programming approach helps in simplifying the programming behind some parallel processing applications.</p>

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>LOGIC PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</h2></div>


  <p>It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism.
In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem. The execution of the program is very much like proof of mathematical statement, e.g., Prolog

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>STRUCTURED PARADIGRAM</h2></div>


  <p>Structured Programming Approach, as the word suggests, can be defined as a programming approach in which the program is made as a single structure. It means that the code will execute the instruction by instruction one after the other. It doesnâ€™t support the possibility of jumping from one instruction to some other with the help of any statement like GOTO, etc. Therefore, the instructions in this approach will be executed in a serial and structured manner. The languages that support Structured programming approach are:</p>
  <p>Languages that use Structured Programming paradigram</p>

    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
