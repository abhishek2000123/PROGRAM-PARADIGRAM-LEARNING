Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. Apart from varieties of programming language there are lots of paradigms to fulfil each and every demand.</p>

<div id="top" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>IMPERATIVE PARADIGRAM</h2></div>


  <p>Imperative programming is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer. Unlike declarative programming, which describes "what" a program should accomplish, imperative programming explicitly tells the computer "how" to accomplish it. Programs written this way often compile to binary executables that run more efficiently since all CPU instructions are themselves imperative statement</p>



  <p>Advantage:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Very simple to implement</li>
    <li>It contains loops, variables etc</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Disadvantage:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Complex problem cannot be solved</li>
    <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
    <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
  </ol>

<div id="dec" class="p-3 mb-2 bg-transparent text-danger"><h2>DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</h2></div>


  <p>Declarative programming is a programming paradigm in which the programmer defines what needs to be accomplished by the program without defining how it needs to be implemented. In other words, the approach focuses on what needs to be achieved instead of instructing how to achieve it. It is different from an imperative program which has the command set to resolve a certain set of problems by describing the steps required to find the solution. Declarative programming describes a particular class of problems with language implementation taking care of finding the solution. The declarative programming approach helps in simplifying the programming behind some parallel processing applications.</p>

  <p>It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism.
In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem. The execution of the program is very much like proof of mathematical statement, e.g., Prolog

  <p>Structured Programming Approach, as the word suggests, can be defined as a programming approach in which the program is made as a single structure. It means that the code will execute the instruction by instruction one after the other. It doesn’t support the possibility of jumping from one instruction to some other with the help of any statement like GOTO, etc. Therefore, the instructions in this approach will be executed in a serial and structured manner.

  <p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

  <ol>
  <li>There are no commands, only side-effect free expressions</li>
  <li>Code is much shorter, less error-prone, and much easier to prove correct</li>
  <li>There is more inherent parallelism, so good compilers can produce faster code</li>

  <p>Finite automata, also known as state machines or FSM (finite-state machines), are a mathematical model of computing used in the design of computer programs and sequential logic circuits. In general, a finite automaton (singular) is a machine that can transition from one state to another.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Automata-based programming is a computer programming paradigm that treats sections of the program as finite automata. Each automaton can take one "step" at a time, and the execution of the program is broken down into individual steps. The steps communicate with each other by changing the value of a variable representing "the state," and control flow of the program is determined by the variable value.The "state" variable can be a simple enum data type, but more complex data structures may be used.</p>

  <p>In computer programming, symbolic programming is a programming paradigm in which the program can manipulate its own formulas and program components as if they were plain data.
Through symbolic programming, complex processes can be developed that build other more intricate processes by combining smaller units of logic or functionality. Thus, such programs can effectively modify themselves and appear to "learn", which makes them better suited for applications such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer games.</p>

<p>The Network paradigm involves thinking of computing in terms of a client, who is essentially in need of some type of information, and a server, who has lots of information and is just waiting to hand it out. Typically, a client will connect to a server and query for certain information. The server will go off and find the information and then return it to the client. In the context of the Internet, clients are typically run on desktop or laptop computers attached to the Internet looking for information, whereas servers are typically run on larger computers with certain types of information available for the clients to retrieve.</p>
  <p>The Web itself is made up of a bunch of computers that act as Web servers; they have vast amounts of HTML pages and related data available for people to retrieve and browse. Web clients are used by those of us who connect to the Web servers and browse through the Web pages.</p>
  <p>Typically, a client will connect to a server and query for certain information. The server will go off and find the information and then return it to the client.
